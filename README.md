# Flappy Bird Game

This is a simple **Flappy Bird** game built using **Java** and **Swing**. The player controls the bird to fly between sets of pipes by pressing the spacebar.



## Features
- Classic Flappy Bird gameplay mechanics.
- Smooth bird movement and pipe generation.
- Real-time score display.
- Game over and restart functionality.

## Game Mechanics

1. **Bird Movement**: 
   - The bird's movement is controlled by the spacebar. Pressing the spacebar makes the bird jump.
   - Gravity constantly pulls the bird down, so you need to keep pressing the spacebar to stay in the air.
   
2. **Pipes**:
   - Pipes randomly appear from the right side of the screen and move leftwards.
   - You score points by passing through the pipes without colliding.

3. **Score**:
   - The score is displayed in the top-left corner.
   - When the bird passes a pair of pipes, the score increases by 1.

4. **Game Over**:
   - The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or falls off the screen.
   - Pressing the spacebar after a game over will reset the game.
